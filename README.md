# portfolio :art:

This portfolio website showcases my past works examples in web development and instructional design.<br/>
The website is developed with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript. </br>
The site is responsive / mobile friendly. Try [it](http://www.jiayiwang.co) on you phone! :iphone: <br/>

The design concept of this portfolio is minimalism. I intendedly didn't include any image on the index page and involved only limited number of texts. <br/>

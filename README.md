My portfolio website is a responsive / web friendly site that showcases my past works examples in web development and instructional design.<br/>
The website is developed with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript. </br>
The design concept of this portfolio is minimalism. I intendedly didn't include any image on the index page and involved only limited number of texts. <br/>
